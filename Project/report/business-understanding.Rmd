# Business understanding

The goal of this phase is to understand the project objetives and what is needed to be able to achieve them, then translate it into a data mining problem definition, which include a designed plan for analysis and aplication step by step.  

## Determine business objectives

In general, the banking business have two main goals: 

- The first, to offer variety of products or services that answers to individual and business customers needs; 
- The second, and the one most important for this project, collect payments from the products provided to their clients with the goal of generating incomes for shareholders.

Both objectives generate an organic balance operation between the customers needs and the gains that the company requires for its operations. However, in this analysis, we will focus on dimishinig the risk linked to the second goal. In other words, we are looking for a good model to forecast which client will have a higher risk of not being able to pay back a credit that has been granted to them. 

Our main goal will be to try to minimize the losses that are given by the sum of the amounts of credit that are given to the people that are perdicted to be positive (hence being eligible for a credit) but that should actually be negative, as they determine a risk for the company of not being able to pay back the amount they received.  

We want to achieve the goal of having the losses being smaller than the 10% of the total amount of the credit that would be granted to the customers.

> Goal: Losses < 10% amount of credit

We will determine it by considering that the company will grant a credit only to those who have a good credit score, and it will not otherwise.

## Assess situation

Now we will take into consideration some assumptions and make the list of the requirements and constraints that the project could have.

|     Assess  | List    |
| :---------  |:-------------:|
| Assumptions | 1) The team members have all the required skills. <br /> 2) The data is real.  |
| Requirements| 1) Boundaries of the work: identify the best model among at least 5 <br /> 2) Submit a report with our findings. <br /> 3) FJFJF.  |
| Constraints | 1) We have about 7 weeks to complete the analysis. <br /> 2) The size of the data set. <br /> 3) Limited input variables |

## Determine data mining goals

The proposed mining goal for this analysis is to obtain a **model** which shows a good evaluation in terms if risk of not paying back given the information of a new person, and hence hepling to decide whether it is a good idea to grant them the credit they are requiring. This algorithm need to have a high accuracy, highlighting the negative impact of a false positive.

**MISSING:Include the exploratory data GOALS**

## Produce project plan

Include an schedule + detailed plan..... (REMAINING)
