"0","#two criteria: MeanDecreaseAccuracy (rough estimate of the loss in prediction performance when that particular variable is omitted from the training set) and Mean Decrease Gini (GINI is a measure of node impurity, highest purity means that each node contains only elements of a single class. Assessing the decrease in GINI when that feature is omitted leads to an understanding of how important that feature is to split the data correctly)"
