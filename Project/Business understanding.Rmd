# Business understanding

The goal of this phase is to understand the project objetives and what is needed to be able to achieve them, then translate them into a data mining problem definition, which includes a designed plan for the analysis and the aplication we will follow step by step.  

## Determine business objectives

In general, the banking business have two main goals: 

- The first, to offer variety of products or services that answers to individual and business customers needs; 
- The second, and the one most important for this project, to collect payments from the products provided to their clients with the goal of generating incomes for shareholders.

Both objectives generate an organic balance operation between the customers needs and the gains that the company requires for its operations. However, in this analysis, we will focus on dimishinig the risk linked to the second goal. In other words, we are looking for a good model to help us forecast which client will have a higher risk of not being able to pay back a loan that has been granted to them. 

Our main goal will be to try to minimize the losses that are given by the sum of the amounts of credit that are given to the people that are predicted to be positive (hence being eligible for a credit) but that should have actually be forecasted as negative, as they determine a risk for the company of not being able to pay back the amount they received.  

We want to achieve the goal of having the losses being smaller than the 10% of the total amount of the credit that would be granted to the customers.

> Goal: Losses < 10% amount of credit

We will determine it by considering that the company will grant a credit only to those who have a good credit score, and it will not otherwise. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Goal of a credit", paged.print=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}

```

## Assess situation

Now we will take into consideration some assumptions and make the list of the requirements and constraints that the project could have.

|     Assess  | List                                                                           |
| :---------  |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assumptions | 1) The team members have all the required skills. <br /> 2) The data is real.  |
| Requirements| 1) Boundaries of the work: identify the best model among at least 5 <br /> 2) Submit a report with our findings.  |
| Constraints | 1) We have about 7 weeks to complete the analysis. <br /> 2) The size of the data set. <br /> 3) Limited input variables |

## Determine data mining goals

The proposed mining goal for this analysis is to obtain a **model** which shows a good evaluation in terms of risk of failure to refund, given the information of a new person, and hence hepling to decide whether it is a good idea to grant them the credit they are requiring. This algorithm needs to have a high accuracy, highlighting the negative impact of a false positive.

The specific goal for the different part of our analysis are the following:

1) **Classification**: Group variables that bring similar information. Potential creation of dummy variables and eliminate the variable which did not bring enough information. 
2) **Prediction**: Find the model that gives us the best predictions comparing them with the testing data.
3) **Optimization**: Maximization of the sensitivity of the data.

## Produce project plan

In order to meet the objectives we have made a gantt chart, the time span considered was divided into 6 weeks from *November 2* to *December 18*.

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Gantt Project", paged.print=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("data/GanttProject.png"))

```


We have followed the deadlines in order to obtain the corresponding feedback for each week.
